        Guide to a good bug-report:
        • Please search existing bug/crash reports to avoid creating duplicates.
        • Give your bug report a good name (no generics like "Error" or "Crash"), so others can easily identify the topic of your issue.
        • Describe the bug in a short but concise way.
        • If you have a screenshot or screen recording of the bug, link them at the end of this issue.
        • Also make sure to fill out the environment information. This info is valuable when trying to fix your described bug.
