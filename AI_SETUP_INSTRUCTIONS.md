# Setting Up AI Features in NeuBoard Keyboard

## Enable AI Suggestions

The NeuBoard keyboard has built-in AI features similar to Microsoft SwiftKey's AI capabilities. Follow these steps to enable them:

1. Open the NeuBoard app settings
2. Navigate to **Settings → Typing**
3. Under the **Suggestions** section, enable the "Suggestions" toggle
   - This will activate the AI quick reply suggestions

## How the AI Features Work

### Quick Reply Suggestions
- When you receive a message in supported messaging apps, NeuBoard will analyze the content and suggest appropriate quick replies
- These replies appear as horizontal buttons above the keyboard
- Simply tap a suggested reply to send it

### Message Context Detection
- The keyboard intelligently detects when you're in a conversation context
- The AI suggestions only appear when appropriate in messaging applications

## Troubleshooting

If AI suggestions don't appear:
1. Make sure the "Suggestions" toggle is enabled in Settings → Typing
2. Ensure you're using the keyboard in a messaging app context
3. Try closing and reopening the messaging app
4. Check that you've received a message that the AI can generate replies for

## Note

The AI feature is context-sensitive and only appears when appropriate in messaging contexts.
